# CLASH (Cluster Lensing and Supernovae with Hubble) Survey.
These softwares were developed for the data acquisition of the CLASH survey published in Molino et al., 2018

The Cluster Lensing And Supernovae survey with Hubble (CLASH; Postman et al. 2012) is a Multi- Cycle Treasury program awarded with 524 HST orbits to image the cores of25 massive galaxy clusters at interme- diate redshifts (0.1<z<0.9). The cluster selection includes 20 X-ray selected dynamically-relaxed systems plus 5 additional specifically-selected strong lensing clusters. CLASH has combined the high spatial-resolution imaging from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with a 16-band filter system optimized for photometric redshift estimations (4 WFC3/UVIS + 5 WFC3/IR + 7 ACS/WFC) and a typical photometric depth of 20 orbits per cluster. The combination of these three elements has made the CLASH survey an unprecedented legacy dataset. The photometric redshift catalogues, derived with such unique dataset, reach an accuracy of dz/(1+z) âˆ¼ 0.8%, 1.0%, and 2.0%for galaxies with I-band F814W AB magnitudes < 18, 20, and 23, respectively (Molino et al. 2017). These catalogues were published at the NASA/MAST archive.
